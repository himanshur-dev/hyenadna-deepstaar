Finetuning a HyenaDNA model on the data from the DeepSTAAR paper

This repository draws much of its code and the model architecture from the authors of HyenaDNA. The paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15794

This repository uses the STAAR-seq data generated from the DeepSTAAR paper. The paper can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01048-5

To run this code, just run hyenadna-regression.ipynb! You can also use this as a general HyenaDNA regression template by swapping in your own datasets and changing the values in the second cell of the notebook; just be sure that your data follows the format of the data in this repository.
